E-Doctor’s Appointment System is a web-based healthcare platform designed to digitalize the process of booking doctor appointments.

It allows patients to register, log in, and schedule appointments online with specialized doctors.

Doctors can manage their appointments, view patient requests, and update the status (approved/pending/completed).

An admin/authority panel oversees the system’s data integrity and overall performance.

The system aims to reduce manual paperwork, minimize waiting time, and make healthcare services more accessible and efficient.
